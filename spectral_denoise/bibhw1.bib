abstract = {Two-dimensional viewing of three-dimensional anatomy by conventional ultrasound limits our ability to quantify and visualize a number of diseases and is partly responsible for the reported variability in diagnosis. Over the past two decades, many investigators have addressed this limitation by developing three-dimensional imaging techniques, including three-dimensional ultrasound imaging. In this paper we describe the development of a number of three-dimensional ultrasound imaging systems that make use of B mode, color Doppler, and power Doppler. In these systems, the conventional ultrasound transducer is scanned mechanically or by a freehand technique. The ultrasound images are digitized and then reconstructed into a three-dimensional volume, which can be viewed and manipulated interactively by the diagnostician with a variety of image-rendering techniques. These developments as well as future trends are discussed with regard to their applications and limitations.},
